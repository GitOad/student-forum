# student-forum
We plan to make a web application. It can provide some services for students, teachers and guests. Different people have different authorities. Basically, there are three main areas corresponding to our project: user interface, server and logic in the back end. We also divide the whole project into four modules: client module, forum module, additional module and administrator module. Each module includes the user interface and logic, realizing different functions through the server.
  # Client module:
Register a new account, log in & log out, edit profile (e.g. password), get the password back if it is forgotten, send messages to others and receive messages from others. Each individual client has its own space to record experience and some valuable highlights should be validated by admin.
  # Forum module:
Post topics & reply to others in the forum, classify each post, report others if their posts are not appropriate. Upload/download small file. Rating & daily recommendation. 

  # Additional module:
Make a small activity of voting and researching, have a relationship network with classmates and teachers, search for some information inside our forum, add an award mechanism which encourage users to sign in for a duration, add some small entertainments to make the website more attractive...
  # Administrator module:
Delete the post which have a bad influence, control the right of posting of every user, ban IDs, appoint sub-chief, issue an announcement, update the forum dynamically...
